# WebVM

**WebVM** is a Linux virtual machine running directly in your browser, powered by WebAssembly and HTML5 technologies. It provides a lightweight, server-less virtualization environment accessible from any modern web browser.

## Key Features

- **WebAssembly-Based**: Executes a Linux virtual machine entirely in the browser using WebAssembly, enabling fast and efficient performance.
- **Server-less Architecture**: No backend server is required, making it easy to deploy and maintain.
- **Full Linux Environment**: Includes a terminal interface with support for common Linux commands and programming tools.
- **Networking Support**: Enables network capabilities for web-based applications and development.
- **Graphical Interface**: Provides a basic graphical desktop environment for lightweight use cases.

## How It Works

WebVM leverages CheerpX, a WebAssembly runtime for x86 binaries, to run Linux in the browser. By using this cutting-edge technology, it delivers a seamless experience for developers and users needing a virtualized environment without the need for additional hardware or software installation.

## Use Cases

- **Programming and Development**: Experiment with programming languages and Linux tools in an isolated environment.
- **Educational Tool**: Teach and learn Linux commands and basic programming without installing a virtual machine.
- **Testing and Prototyping**: Quickly test scripts or applications in a secure, disposable Linux instance.
- **Web-Based Applications**: Deploy lightweight Linux applications directly in the browser.

2. Launch the terminal or graphical desktop environment.
3. Begin using Linux commands or programming tools within the virtual machine.
